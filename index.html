                    <p>You were a contender in high school, or maybe even college, but those days are long gone.
                        But wait! You have been unexpectedly called back into action,
                        forced to flex those skills to a group of unskilled rookies.
                        Now if only you could remember those drills you used to do? Don't worry, we got you.
